# Elsa Server + Studio - Single Image

### Docker Compose Configuration﻿ <a href="#docker-compose-configuration" id="docker-compose-configuration"></a>

Below is an example Docker Compose configuration that sets up the Elsa Server + Studio application:

```yaml
services:

    # Elsa Studio and Server from a single image.
    elsa-server-and-studio:
        image: elsaworkflows/elsa-server-and-studio-v3-5-0:latest
        pull_policy: always
        environment:
            ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT: Development
            HTTP_PORTS: 8080
            HTTP__BASEURL: http://localhost:14000
        ports:
            - "14000:8080"
```

### Steps to Set Up﻿ <a href="#steps-to-set-up" id="steps-to-set-up"></a>

* Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in your project directory with the above configuration.
* Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. Refer to the [prerequisites documentation](https://elsa-workflows.github.io/elsa-documentation/prerequisites.html#docker) for installation guidance.
* Open a terminal in the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.
*   Run the following command to start the container:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

### Accessing Elsa﻿ <a href="#accessing-elsa" id="accessing-elsa"></a>
